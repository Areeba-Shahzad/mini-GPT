    "\n",
    "Embeddings are a way to represent words (or more generally, *tokens*) as vectors. These vectors are useful for many tasks in NLP, including but not limited to: Text Generation, Machine Translation, and Sentence Classification. In this notebook, we will be exploring the concept of Embeddings, and using them for Sentence Classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concepts of Embeddings and Vector Similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use pre-trained Embeddings for Sentence Classification.\n",
